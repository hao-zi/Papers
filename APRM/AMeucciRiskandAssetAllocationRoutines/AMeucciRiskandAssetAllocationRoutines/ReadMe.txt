The files named "S_***" are scripts, which can be run independently
The remaining files are functions, which are called from within the scripts
In this updated version I have included the documentation within the scripts.
A preliminary, now obsolete, version of these routines was accompanied by a .pdf docmumentation. 
Both preliminary routines and documentation can still be downloaded from:
